We can inspect or use shortcuts to access it


Browser Developer Tools, also known as DevTools, are a set of built-in tools provided by web browsers that help developers inspect, debug, and profile web applications. They offer a wide range of features and capabilities for analyzing and manipulating web content, JavaScript code, network traffic, and more. The DevTools are available in popular web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

Here are some key features of browser DevTools:

HTML and CSS Inspection: DevTools allow developers to inspect and modify the HTML structure and CSS styles of a web page. This helps in understanding how the page is structured, identifying layout issues, and experimenting with different styles in real-time.

JavaScript Debugging: DevTools provide powerful debugging capabilities for JavaScript code. Developers can set breakpoints, step through code execution, inspect variables, and watch expressions to identify and fix issues in their code. It also includes features like call stack tracing and error reporting.

Network Analysis: DevTools enable monitoring and analyzing network requests made by a web application. Developers can inspect HTTP requests and responses, examine request headers and payloads, analyze response times, and identify performance bottlenecks or network-related issues.

Performance Profiling: DevTools include performance profiling tools that help identify performance bottlenecks in a web application. Developers can record and analyze CPU usage, memory consumption, JavaScript execution time, and other performance metrics to optimize the application's speed and efficiency.

Mobile Device Emulation: DevTools offer the ability to emulate different mobile devices and view how web applications appear and behave on various screen sizes and resolutions. This helps developers ensure responsive design and optimal user experience across different devices.

Console and Logging: DevTools provide a console interface where developers can execute JavaScript code, log messages, and inspect runtime errors. It allows interactive experimentation and provides a way to log diagnostic information during development.

Live Editing and CSS Tweaking: DevTools enable live editing of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, allowing developers to experiment with changes in real-time and see the immediate impact on the rendered web page. This can be particularly useful for rapid prototyping and fine-tuning the appearance and behavior of a web application.

These are just some of the many features available in browser DevTools. Each browser may have its own set of additional features and unique capabilities, but the core functionalities remain consistent across most modern browsers.

To access the DevTools, you can typically right-click on a web page and choose "Inspect" or use keyboard shortcuts like F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I. The DevTools window will then open, providing a powerful set of tools to assist in web development and debugging.
