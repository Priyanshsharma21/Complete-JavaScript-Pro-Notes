Javascript is dynamic datatype it means we don't have to specify the datatype of the variable.

Statically type language like c c++ java we have to declear the datatype fo the variable.

Javascript python are dynamic in which we can assign multiple data type value

Number is no other than that.

Javascript implicetly identify it wether it is a number or float.


let a = 10
let a = 10.2232


Boolean - True or false.
True - yes, correct 1
False - no, incorrect 0



null - represent nothing - means this field is nothing - intentionally

undefine - A variable in which value is not been assigned is undefine


difference - undefine - A variable is decleared but not assigned value.
null is assigned value.



type of null is object - It is a bug that JS team never figure out
