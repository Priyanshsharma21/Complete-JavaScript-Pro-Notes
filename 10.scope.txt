Scope shows the availablity of variables.


Three Types - 
1. Global
2. Local
3. Block

Variables inside the functions are functional scope.
Variables declear outside any function or block are global
variables declear inside a block are block scope like function, ifelse,loops

Global - 
This are declear outside and can be access by any function or any block.

Too many global can cause problem like memory issues cause run in bg.

Any block can change it.


Local- function scope.
so the variable decler inside the function can be accessnly in the function and inner function . 

Inner can access outer but outer cannot access inner variables



Block - Variables present in bliock like - function, ifelse, loops.

But var - this is bot the case, it will be functional scope.
